\subsection{Psychoacoustics: Facts and models}

There are two kinds of perceptual effects that arise due to the modulation of
sounds: fluctuation strength and roughness. The soft limit (i.e.\ there is a
smooth transition between the sensations) occurs at approximately 20 Hz. For
frequencies below this limit is where the fluctuation strength perception
corresponds.
