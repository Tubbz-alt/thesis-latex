\customtitle{Fluctuation Strength Battery Test}

\section{Introduction}

This document details a series of test that will be used to validate model
implementations of fluctuation strength. These tests will be based on the
reference value of fluctuation strength and its the parametric dependencies.

\section{Reference Value}

An AM (amplitude-modulated) tone ($f_c = 1$ kHz, $f_m = 4$ Hz, $m_d = 1$,
SPL $=60$ dB) serves as the reference value for fluctuation strength, with a
value of 1 vacil assigned to it. As so, the model implementation must comply
with this requisite.

\section{Tests}

This section details the specific tests that the model must pass to be
considered adequate. According to the type of input stimuli different tests
will be specified, starting with AM tones and then expanding to FM
(frequency-modulated) tones and AM BBN (broadband noise).
