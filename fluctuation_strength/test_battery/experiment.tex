\customtitle{Fluctuation Strength Test Battery Experiment}

\section{Introduction}

This document describes the experimental setup proposed to obtain the data
needed regarding the tests described in the fluctuation strength test battery.
The results of pilot experiments are also reported.

\section{Results}

\subsection{AM Tones}

\subsubsection{Modulation Frequency}

Figure \ref{fig:expres} shows the results regarding the relation between
fluctuation strength and modulation frequency.
