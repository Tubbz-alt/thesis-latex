\customtitle{Fluctuation Strength Test Battery Results}

\section{Introduction}

This document presents the results obtained by validating our fluctuation
strength model against the tests contained in the test battery.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Reference Value}

Using the model implementation a value of 1.008473 vacil is obtained for the
reference tone.

\subsection{AM Tones}

\subsubsection{Modulation Frequency}

Figure \ref{fig:AMtonesfmplot} shows the relation between fluctuation strength
and modulation frequency, as estimated by the model.

        tones with $f_c = 1 $ kHz, $m_d = 1$, SPL $= 70$.}

\subsubsection{Carrier Frequency}

Figure \ref{fig:AMtonesfcplot} shows the relation between fluctuation strength
and carrier frequency, as estimated by the model.

        tones with $f_m = 4 $ Hz, $m_d = 1$, SPL $= 70$.}
