\customtitle{Fluctuation Strength Test Battery Results}

\section{Introduction}

This document presents the results obtained by validating our fluctuation
strength model against the tests contained in the test battery.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Reference Value}

Using the model implementation a value of 1.016267 vacil is obtained for the
reference tone.

\subsection{AM Tones}

\subsubsection{Modulation Frequency}

Figure \ref{fig:AMtonesfmplot} shows the relation between fluctuation strength
and modulation frequency, as estimated by the model.

        tones with $f_c = 1 $kHz, $m_d = 40 $dB, SPL $= 70 $dB}

\subsubsection{Carrier Frequency}

Figure \ref{fig:AMtonesfcplot} shows the relation between fluctuation strength
and carrier frequency, as estimated by the model.

        tones with $f_m = 4 $Hz, $m_d = 40 $dB, SPL $= 70 $dB}

\subsubsection{Sound Pressure Level}

Figure \ref{fig:AMtonesSPLplot} shows the relation between fluctuation strength
and sound pressure level, as estimated by the model.

        tones with $f_c = 1 $kHz, $f_m = 4 $Hz, $m_d = 40 $dB}

\subsubsection{Modulation Depth}

Figure \ref{fig:AMtonesmdplot} shows the relation between fluctuation strength
and modulation depth, as estimated by the model.
