\customtitle{Fluctuation Strength Model Implementation}

\section{Introduction}

The following document details the implementation of a fluctuation strength
model, based on the roughness model implemented by \citeauthor{Schrader2002}.
This is similar to the work of \citeauthor{Sontacchi1998}, which will be also
taken into account when making the necessary adjustments.
