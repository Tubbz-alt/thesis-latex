\customtitle{Fluctuation Strength Model Implementation}

\section{Introduction}

The following document details the implementation of a fluctuation strength
model, based on the roughness model implemented by \citeauthor{Schrader2002}.
This is similar to the work of \citeauthor{Sontacchi1998}, which will be also
taken into account when making the necessary adjustments.

\section{Implementation}

The following are implementation details of the roughness model that probably
will have to be adjusted for the fluctuation strength model.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Does the FFT resolution affects in any way the results of the model?
    \item \matlabinline{Hweight} models the bandpass response of the modulation
        frequency, do these weights have to be changed for the fluctuation
        strength case?
    \item \matlabinline{gzi} represents the effect of the carrier frequency on
        the output, do these values have to be changed for the fluctuation
        strength case?
    \item Does the relation $f_s \propto m_d ^ 2$ still holds?
\end{itemize}
