\chapter{General Methods}
\label{cha:methods}

This chapter describes the general methods.

\section{Equipment}

A personal computer with an audio interface M-Audio Transit and a set of
headphones Sennheiser HD 265 Linear were used to conduct the experiment. The
headphones provided a diffuse-field equalization to the reproduced sounds. The
sampling rate was set to 44.1~kHz. The computer was positioned in a
sound-isolated booth. The experiment itself was programmed using the APEX
software platform~\cite{Francart2008} and Windows batch files.

\section{Stimuli}
\label{sec:stimuli}

All the sounds presented during the experiment consisted of diotic stimuli,
where a monaural stimulus is reproduced for both ears simultaneously. Two
types of stimuli were considered: \gls{AM} tones, \Cref{eq:am}; and \gls{FM}
tones, \Cref{eq:fm}. In these equations, a phase shift of $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ was
introduced to the modulating signal for both tones in order to start the
corresponding modulation at its lowest point. This phase shift is needed to
avoid pops and clicks due to an abrupt onset when presenting the sounds to the
participants. Additionally, a cosine ramp with attack and release times of 25 ms
was applied to the stimuli to further prevent this phenomenon.

\begin{equation}
  x_{am} = [1 - m_i \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_m t)] \cdot A \cdot \sin(2 \pi f_c t),
  \label{eq:am}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  m_i = \frac{m_d^{\prime}-1}{m_d^{\prime}+1},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  m_d^{\prime} = 10^{\frac{m_d}{20}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  x_{fm} = A \cdot \sin \{2 \pi [f_c - d_f \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_m t)] t \}
  \label{eq:fm}
\end{equation}

The duration of the stimuli was specified such that it presented at least three
periods of the modulating signal, within a range of values between 2 and
4~seconds. Therefore, stimuli with long periods (e.g., $f_m$ = 0.25~Hz) were
truncated to 4~seconds and stimuli with short periods (e.g., $f_m$ = 32~Hz) were
generated to reach a 2~seconds duration. This was done to maintain a similar
duration among stimuli while keeping the whole experiment duration to an
acceptable value.

Furthermore, the stimuli were generated such that a level of 100 dB SPL value
corresponds to a 0 dBFS value.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\glsreset{f_m}
\glsreset{f_c}
\glsreset{SPL}
\glsreset{d_f}
\glsreset{m_d}

A magnitude estimation procedure~\cite[pp.~9]{Fastl2007Psychoacoustics} was used
to obtain the relative fluctuation strength as a function of a varying parameter
for the two types of tones. Four different parametric variations were used:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Gls{f_m}
  \item \Gls{f_c}
  \item \Gls{SPL}
  \item \Gls{m_d} for \gls{AM} tones; \gls{d_f} for \gls{FM} tones
\end{itemize}
These parametric variations were chosen in order to assess all the dependencies
that the sensation of fluctuation strength presents in regard to the type of
stimuli used. Each of these parameters defined an experiment section on its own.

For each magnitude estimation procedure pairs of sounds were presented, composed
of one of two possible standards (\Cref{tab:standards}) and a stimulus from the
section set. The standard and the stimulus are separated by a 800 ms silence.
There were four repetitions per pair, and hence eight per stimulus. The
selection of the standard and the stimulus used is randomized. After each
pair presentation, the participant must indicate how much does the second
sound fluctuate with respect to the first one. A screenshot of the final
experiment design in shown in \Cref{fig:apex}.
