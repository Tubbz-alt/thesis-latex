\chapter{Discussion}

This chapter develops on the insights gathered from the experimental and
modeling phases of the study. First the remarks concerning the experiments will
be addressed, and later the details regarding the model will be explored.

\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Methods}

The training phase, product of the pilot experiments carried out before the
actual experimental, proved to be beneficial. Participants were able to
understand better the concept of fluctuation strength as a result of the
presentation of key examples, the stimuli comparison section of the training
phase. Nonetheless, the confusion between roughness and fluctuation strength was
not completely eliminated. In the modulation frequency sections of the
experiment, some participants exhibited increasing values of fluctuation
strength as the modulation frequency increased too. This reveals a lack of
understanding of the sensation. However, the concept of fluctuation strength is
difficult to grasp, and it depends largely on individuals' past experiences and
capability to focus on the stimuli correctly. As so, some confusion will always
exists, and this phenomena can only be reduced so much.

Furthermore, the instructions that the participants received, and how they
understand them, can influence greatly the expected results. In this case,
participants were told to focus on the actual sensation of fluctuation and they
should not try to associate it to any physical parameters of the sounds, namely
modulation frequency which leads to the roughness confusion. Some participants
interpreted this as meaning that they should negate any other physical parameter
effects on the fluctuation as long as it does not affects it directly. For
example, sound pressure level would sometimes be considered to have a flat
response since it does not modifies the modulation itself, only the sound's
loudness. Explicitly addressing these facts could leads to more accurate
fluctuation estimation on behalf of the participants.

Expanding on the training phase, the stimuli comparison and the test section
experiment parts of it proved to be helpful for participants. The sequential
stimuli section was not that helpful as the other sections, as participants
always stated that they could difference the stimuli. This latter section
could be removed from future experiment, in order to make them shorter and
easier on the participants.

With regard to the experimental sections themselves, some participants noted
the fact that the slider would not reset to its original position after each
trial was done. This was a technical limitation, due to software errors in the
chosen platform. Although one may wonder whether the fact that slider's initial
position could somehow affect participants' responses, changing the starting
100\% reference point from a visual point of view, nothing but speculation
can be formulated at this point.

The experiment duration rounds about an hour, and participants were required to
be sited and watching at computer screen while listening continuously for the
duration. Although rests between the experimental sections were proposed to
participants, almost none of them took them, preferring to finish the experiment
as fast as possible. Moreover, some participants reported feeling tired, dizzy
or with a slight headache after the experiment's conclusion. These tiredness
effects were intended to be balanced with the use of the latin square design,
so they would distribute among experimental conditions. Another possible
solution would be to reduce the number of repetitions per pair presentation.
The chosen value, 4, was obtained from \citeauthor{Fastl1982Fluctuation}'s
experiment~\cite{Fastl1982Fluctuation}, as it provided a $\pm10$ value deviation
between answers. Related to experimental duration, the sections corresponding to
the modulation frequency dependency were split in two, to maintain all sections
duration around 6 minutes. Whether this introduces any changes in participants
responses is unknown.

\subsection{Results}

The fluctuation strength as a function of modulation frequency curves, both for
\gls{am} and \gls{fm} tones present the expected bandpass response, although
the bandwidth of these response is wider than that reported by
\citeauthor{Fastl2007Psychoacoustics}. One possible reason for this is the
influence of the additional tones ($f_m = \{0, 64, 128\}$ Hz), added to
counteract the confusion of roughness and fluctuation strength. This changes
the lowest and highest values present for modulation frequency. These points
act as anchors, providing participants with values that implicitly have an
almost zero value of fluctuation strength. As so, the response is ``stretched'',
similar to the obtained results. Furthermore, during the realization of the
experiment participants are exposed slowly to the whole range of fluctuation
values. Since they usually do not have the concept completely clear from the
start, during the realization of the experiment they progressively adjust the
internal references values assigned to the two standards provided. This could
also explain why in general responses are higher. {\color{red} \bf (CHECK
\cite{Krantz1972} and~\cite{Marley1972} FOR SUPPORT ON THIS)}

Regarding the fluctuation strength as a function of center frequency, for
\gls{am} a mostly flat response was found. Although it is somewhat different
from that presented by \citeauthor{Fastl2007Psychoacoustics}, this data also
presents large \gls{IQR} values. Therefore the obtained curve is deemed to be
qualitatively similar. With respect to \gls{fm} tones the obtained data
deviates significantly from \citeauthor{Fastl2007Psychoacoustics}, the former
having a flat trendy, while the latter presents a monotonic descent as the
center frequency increases. This difference will be addressed later, when the
frequency deviation curve will be discussed.

The \gls{spl} curves present some minor differences but overall are consistent
with the expected behavior, regardless of the comments that participants made
about its impact on the actual fluctuation strength value.

The last two parameters, modulation depth and frequency deviation, present also
systematical variations with respect to those reported by
\citeauthor{Fastl2007Psychoacoustics}. Since these two parameters can be
considered analogous indicators for the amount of modulation for each type of
tone, they will be analyzed at the same time. Participants exhibit a lack of
sensitivity to changes in modulation, resulting in higher than expected values
for both curves. A small value of \gls{m_d} or \gls{d_f} results in a higher
value of fluctuation, while the increase of modulation resulting in a less
steep increase in fluctuation.

For \gls{fm} tones, this lack of sensitivity can also explain the differences
found in the center frequency and frequency deviation curves. In both cases,
the number of auditory filters excited by the incoming signal is dependence on
the parameters. For center frequency, an increase of frequency corresponds to a
decrease in the number of filters excited, since for higher frequency the
auditory filters present wider bandwidths. For the frequency deviation the
opposite occurs, since as the frequency deviation increases the stimulus
bandwidth increases to, resulting in a higher number of auditory filters covered
by it. Therefore, both deviations can be explained by the fact, when a low
number of auditory filters are excited, their responses result in higher
fluctuation values, that increase with a flatter slope as the number of excited
filters increase.

Finally, due to the change of both center frequency and number of auditory
filters excited inherently present in the center frequency curve for \gls{fm}
tones, this particular response is not very suitable for analyzing only the
effect of center frequency itself. As an improvement to the methodology,
stimuli with a lower value for deviation frequency could be used, to eliminate
the auditory filters effect.

\section{Model}

\subsection{Results}

Overall the model provides an acceptable estimate for the fluctuation strength
values presented by the experimental data. However, it adapts better to the
\gls{am} tones than to the \gls{fm} tones. This make sense, since the model
was intended to be used with \gls{am} stimuli, hence the fundamental use of
modulation depth (a property found in \gls{am} only) to estimate the amount of
fluctuation. Therefore, a trade-off must be established when adjusting the model
parameters having each type of tone in mind. Nevertheless, the model predicts
values close to those found in the data for \gls{fm} tones. One possible
improvement in this regard in to substitute the generalized modulation depth
formula proposed by \citeauthor{daniel1997psychoacoustical} with a modulation
filterbank, that could model better the energy distribution of the signal
among specific frequency bands. {\bf \color{red} (CHECK \cite{Dau1997} for
support on this)}

\subsection{Limitations}

The use of the absolute value of cross correlation coefficients may pose
problems when using the model with \gls{BBN} \gls{am} tones, the other type
of stimulus used by \citeauthor{Fastl2007Psychoacoustics} in their study.

The increased frame size needed to achieve the frequency resolution for the
model renders it unfeasible to implement in practical application. Currently
a frame size of $2Ë†20$ samples is needed, which corresponds to around 24 seconds
for a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz.

Finally, more modern modeling techniques, such as the use of the ERB perceptual
scale and a Gammatone filterbank instead of \citeauthor{Terhardt1979}'s can be
implemented, to improve the model and bring it to a more up to date state.
