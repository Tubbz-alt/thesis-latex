\section{Summmary}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Experiment
  \begin{itemize}
    \item sequential stimuli in training phase useless
    \item for FM tones, center frequeency experiment not very representative
    \item possible confusion of participants, fixation on modulation and not
      on sensation
    \item modulation frequency curves have the expected bandpass response,
      although the bandwidth of these responses is wider
    \item long duration -> participants tired; reduce number of repetitions?
      this could affect the outcome? (medians with big IQR)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item addition of tones in modulation frequency conditions can bias
        results? this could also explain the shift in the peak value of the
        curve
      \item AM curve presents more uncertainty that FM curve, is this an
        indication that fm fluctuation is easier to understand than AM?
    \end{itemize}
    \item AM-fc presents a flat response, different from Fastl's but deemed
      satisfactory due to the high uncertainty in the original results
    \item SPL curves present some variations but overall behave as expected
   \end{itemize}
    \item There are sistematical variations in the AM-md, FM-fc and FM-df curves
    \item Taking md and df as analogous quantities, participants seem to exhibit
      a high sensitivity towards these parameters
  \item Model
\end{itemize}
