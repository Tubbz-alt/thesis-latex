\chapter{Experimental Design and Results}

In this chapter the final experimental design and results are presented.

\section{Design}

\subsection{Equipment}

The same equipment used in the pilot experiments was used in the final
experiments (\ref{subsec:pilot_equipment}).

\subsection{Methods}

A total of 24 participants completed the experiment. Participants was assigned
either to \gls{AM} tones or to \gls{FM} tones, both conditions having 12
participants. Furthermore, as in the pilot experiment, the experiment was
divided in the phases. The experiment protocol followed during the experiment
can be found in the appendix of this document (\ref{chap:experiment_protocol}).

\subsubsection{Training phase}

Adding all the improvements postulated in the pilot experiment section, the
training phase was expanded and become a 3-part phase.

\paragraph{Stimuli comparison}

As in the pilot experiments, the initial part of the training phase consisted
of comparison between stimuli. An additional stimulus was added ($f_m = 128$ Hz)
and a subset of \gls{FM} stimuli was also added to complements the \gls{AM}
tones. The stimuli presented in
\cref{tab:am_training_stimuli,tab:fm_training_stimuli} were used.

\paragraph{Longer stimulus}

More stimuli were added to the longer stimulus, and an additional stimulus was
generated composed uniquely of \gls{FM} tones. These two stimuli are described
in \cref{tab:am_all_stimulus,tab:fm_all_stimulus}.

\paragraph{Test section}

In order to familiarize participant with the interface used during the
experiment and with the magnitude estimation procedure, a small test section
was added at the end of the training phase. This section consisted of four
pairs (\Cref{tab:pairs_test_section}), which were presented to the participants
in randomized order.

\subsubsection{Experimental phase}

In comparison to the pilot experiment, the experimental phase remained almost
without changes. The only effective change was the splitting of the modulation
frequency sections (AM-fm and FM-fm) into two separate sections. This was done
due to the longer duration of these sections when compared to the others ones.
By keeping all the sections relatively short (around 6 minutes each) it was
expected that participants attention and focus would be retained from one
section to another.

\subsection{Stimuli}

The stimuli used in the final experiment present the same characteristics as the
ones used in the pilot experiments (\ref{subsec:pilot_stimuli}).
\Cref{tab:stimuli} details the stimuli used in the final experiments.
