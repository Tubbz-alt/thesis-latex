\chapter{Theoretical Background}

First a small overview of the perceptual processes and their associated
perceptual quantities is given. \Cref{tab:stimsens} summarizes all the
perceptual measures, along with their dominant physical stimuli. It is
interesting to note that all these perceptual dimensions, except for density,
were derived from the ``Munich school'' work of Zwicker and
Fastl~\cite{Fastl2007Psychoacoustics}.

It is important to note that the human auditory system can generate these
perceptual sensations independently of each other, although to understand the
general ``pleasantness'' of a sound a bigger context needs to be taken into
account. For instance the emotions of the listeners can have an important
effect on the cognitive construal of a given sound.
