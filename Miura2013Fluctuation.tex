\section{Fluctuation strength on real sound: motorbike exhaust and marimba
    tremolo}

The paper by \citet{Miura2013Fluctuation} proposes a modified model of
fluctuation strength to analyze motorbike exhaust and marimba tremolo sounds.
The model is based on a multiple regression composed of Zwicker's fluctuation
strength model value, and several other factors depending on the sound
analyzed.
