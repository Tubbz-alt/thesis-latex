\customtitle{\citeauthor{Schrader2002} Roughness Model Analysis}

\section{Introduction}

This document contains several notes regarding the implementation and the
obtained results of using the Roughness model implementation in MATLAB by
\citet{Schrader2002}. This implementation is based on the work of
\cite{aures1985berechnungsverfahren} and \citet{daniel1997psychoacoustical}.

Furthermore, since the models of roughness and fluctuation strength are similar,
relevant details for the implementation of a fluctuation strength model will be
taken from the implementation of roughness model at hand.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Terhardt slopes steepness calculation}

Regarding the calculation of the steep of Terhardt slopes, a possible error was
detected in the source code. Listing~\ref{lst:terhardt} shows the specific code
under questioning.

\lstset{inputpath=/Users/rodrigo/Documents/MATLAB/MATLAB_shared/Psychoacoustics}
\lstinputlisting[
    style=MATLAB-editor,
    firstline=18,
    lastline=26,
    caption={Terhardt slopes steepness calculation},
    label={lst:terhardt}
]{Roughness_Rodrigo/Roughness.m}

Line 5 of the code uses the expression \matlabinline{(230 / params.freqs(w))},
in which the variable \matlabinline{w} is used as index of the frequencies,
instead of \matlabinline{whichL(w)}. Therefore it may be that the used
frequencies are not the correct ones, and errors might arise from this fact.

\section{Results}

In order to check the reliability of the results of the model implementation,
several plots from the original references were recreated. More specifically,
the upper left plots from Figure 3~\cite[pp.~118]{daniel1997psychoacoustical}
were made again. Two sets of plots were made, one were the original source code
was used (Figure\ref{fig:rwoc}), and another one were the correction to the
frequency indexes of Listing~\ref{lst:terhardt} was used (Figure~\ref{fig:rwc}).
From the graphs it can be seen that there is a difference of about 0.25 asper in
the values obtained. However, the uncorrected values are aligned with those
present in \citeauthor{daniel1997psychoacoustical} (Figure~\ref{fig:rorigfig}).
