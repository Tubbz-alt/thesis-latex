The following are the results of all the participants grouped together by
experiment. In the appendix the individual results can be found. In all the
following figures, the error bars indicate the interquartile range and the
marker indicates the median value. The combined curve of the two standards is
obtained considering the median value of all the observations in total for a
given parameter value (8 in total). In Table~\ref{tab:standards} the standards
used in each experiments are detailed. The model results correspond to a model
fitted to Fastl's data.

\section{Discussion} % (fold)
\label{sec:discussion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Both modulation frequency curves differ a little from Fastl curves,
  although they both present the bandpass response
  \item Regarding FM tones, there are a couple of cases where a confusion
  between roughness and fluctuation can be appreciated from the curves (upward
  slope)
  \item Although the individual responses for the center frequency curve of AM
  tones are quite different among each other, the overall curve seems to be ok
  \item The center frequency curve for FM tones differs completely from Fastl
  data
  \item Both SPL curves present a increasing trend like Fastl data, although
  they decrease their slope at lower values of SPL
  \item In some cases there are flat response curves for SPL, this is due a
  confusion to whether the SPL should be considered as a relevant variable for
  fluctuation, as states by various participants at the end of the experiment
  \item Participant 2 can be considered an outlier for SPL
  \item The modulation depth curve presents concave down increasing response
  instead of a concave up increasing response
  \item The frequency deviation curve is shifted due to a large value at the
  lowest frequency
